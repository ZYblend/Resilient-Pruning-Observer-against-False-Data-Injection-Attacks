# How to use the codes
## simulation of Machine learning of oracle
   (Refer to: ***Localization_oracle.m***)
   We use the Bernoulli uncertainty model to simulate the result of any machine learning localization algorithm's results.
## codes of pruning algorithm
   (Refer to: ***robustneess_support***)
