# How to use the codes
## simulation of machine learning oracle
   (Refer to: ***Localization_oracle.m***) <br />
   We use the Bernoulli uncertainty model to simulate the result of any machine learning localization algorithm's results.
## codes of pruning algorithm
   (Refer to: ***robustneess_support***) <br />
## Note: the way to use the upper two set of codes
    Refer to *Pruning_observer_inexact/Attack_localization_and_Removing/Attack_localization* block)
